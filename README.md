# Understanding Container Technologies

## Container

A container is a lightweight package that holds everything an application needs to run. It includes the app's code, all the tools and libraries the app needs to work, and settings, ensuring the app runs the same way on any system. Containers help developers easily share and deploy applications without worrying about compatibility issues.

**Example**: Imagine you’re cooking a meal. You pack all the ingredients, the recipe, and the cooking tools into one box. Now, no matter where you go your kitchen, a friend’s house, or even a different country you can make the exact same meal because you have everything you need in that box.
In the same way, a container holds everything an app needs, so it will work the same no matter where you run it on your computer, a server, or in the cloud.

## 1. Container Runtime

A container runtime is the software responsible for running containers. In simple terms, it's like an engine that makes sure containers can start, stop, and manage themselves on your system.

**How does it work?**  

* Imagine you have a box containing an application and all its necessary files. The container runtime is responsible for opening that box, executing the application, and managing resources such as CPU and memory for the application.
